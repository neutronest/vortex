# vortex

## Introduction

Vortex is designed to be a Haskell implementation of Deep Learning frameworks.However it still keep developing. We hope this tool support:

* Common neural layer types, such as Sigmoid, Softmax, Relu, &etc.

* Multiple optimazation algorithms. SGD and Aladelta is proposed.

* Some real world deep learning models. For instance, CNN, RNN, LSTM are all necessery. Futher on We also hope the Neural Turning Machine(NTM) is not immature if possible. 

* Some interested DEMOS. Image Regresssion, Image Classification, Neural Art, language modeling, &etc. 

## TODO List (recent)

* Common layers implementation: sigmoid, linear, softmax, relu, dropout.

* Optimazation algorithms.

* Image regression.
